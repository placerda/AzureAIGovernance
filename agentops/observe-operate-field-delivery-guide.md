# AgentOps Observability and Operations Guide

## Purpose and intended audience

This guide helps Microsoft field teams establish observability and Day-2
operations for AI agents. It is intended for architects, agent engineers,
Copilot Studio makers, site reliability and operations teams, service owners,
security teams, Responsible AI practitioners, support teams, and delivery leads
working with:

- Microsoft Foundry agents
- Microsoft Copilot Studio agents

Use it to define operational outcomes and signals, select tooling, prepare
telemetry and response procedures, execute monitoring and operational readiness,
and establish a continuous improvement loop.

This is practical execution guidance. It is not a Statement of Work, a
commercial scope, a Definition of Use, or a detailed product runbook.

## Supported platforms and boundaries

| Area | Microsoft Foundry | Microsoft Copilot Studio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native operational view | Foundry traces and Agent Monitoring Dashboard connected to Azure Monitor/Application Insights | Copilot Studio Analytics and Monitor experiences for sessions, runs, reactions, tool use, response quality, and outcomes |
| Extended telemetry | OpenTelemetry and Application Insights for application, model, tool, dependency, and custom operational signals | Optional agent-level Application Insights telemetry and customer analytics over approved transcript or Dataverse data |
| Quality in production | Scheduled or continuous evaluation where supported, correlated with traces | Recurring test sets plus analytics-derived scenarios; native analytics and evaluation are distinct evidence sources |
| Incident learning | Trace and evaluation evidence can be promoted into regression coverage | Sessions, transcripts, themes, reactions, failures, and support cases can become new Copilot Studio test cases |
| AgentOps Accelerator | Foundry-specific reference for reading Foundry/Application Insights signals, readiness findings, and evidence packaging | Not a Copilot Studio observability product or implementation path |

Do not build a single dashboard that hides platform differences. Preserve the
native operational source, identity, retention, and access model for each
platform, then aggregate only the signals needed for customer decisions.

## Engagement outcomes

By the end of the workstream, the customer should have:

1. Operational outcomes, service objectives, and critical user journeys.
2. A signal catalog covering quality, safety, reliability, performance, cost,
   adoption, and business outcomes.
3. Telemetry, dashboards, alerts, and privacy controls appropriate to the
   selected platform.
4. Incident triage and runbook outlines linked to agent evidence.
5. A production-readiness and operational rehearsal record.
6. A process for turning production learning into evaluation and release
   improvements.
7. Named customer owners for platform, service, quality, safety, and support.

## Delivery outline

| Phase | Delivery question | Expected evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Discover outcomes and signals | What must operators know to protect users and business outcomes? | Operational charter, service objectives, signal catalog |
| 2. Select tooling | Which native and extended telemetry surfaces provide trustworthy, supportable evidence? | Tooling decision record, data-flow and access design |
| 3. Prepare telemetry, alerts, and runbooks | Is the agent diagnosable and are responders ready before production? | Instrumentation plan, dashboards, alert design, runbook outlines |
| 4. Execute observability and operations | Do signals arrive, alerts work, and responders resolve realistic failures? | Verification record, alert tests, incident rehearsal |
| 5. Continuously improve | How will production learning change tests, controls, and releases? | Review cadence, feedback loop, prioritized improvements |
| 6. End the project and transfer knowledge | Can the customer operate the service without the delivery team? | Handoff pack, operator rehearsal, owner acceptance |

## Phase 1 - Discover operational outcomes and signals

### Objective

Define observability from customer outcomes and operational decisions, not from
the list of available dashboards.

### Discovery questions

#### Outcomes and service expectations

- Which user and business outcomes must the agent achieve in production?
- Which journeys are critical, regulated, revenue-affecting, or safety-sensitive?
- What are acceptable availability, latency, error, completion, escalation, and
  recovery expectations?
- Which channels, languages, geographies, personas, and event triggers require
  separate monitoring?
- What is the expected traffic pattern, concurrency, seasonality, and growth?
- What is the support model and who owns the service outside business hours?

#### Agent behavior and dependencies

- Which models, tools, actions, child agents, knowledge sources, connectors, and
  external services are on the critical path?
- Which failures are visible to users and which can silently degrade quality?
- Which identity, permission, quota, capacity, network, or data freshness issues
  can change behavior?
- How are agent versions, source commits, solution versions, and environment
  identities represented in telemetry?

#### Quality, safety, and business signals

- Which quality dimensions should be monitored after deployment?
- What constitutes unsafe, disallowed, over-permissioned, or anomalous behavior?
- Which user feedback, reaction, outcome, abandonment, escalation, or task
  completion signals matter?
- Which signals require human review rather than automated interpretation?
- What cost or token behavior requires alerting or review?

#### Privacy and governance

- Which prompts, responses, tool arguments, transcripts, and identifiers may
  contain personal, confidential, or regulated data?
- What may be collected, sampled, redacted, exported, and retained?
- Who can view analytics, transcripts, traces, and raw content?
- Which evidence must be preserved for audit or incident response?

### Activities

1. Map critical journeys to service objectives and operator decisions.
2. Build a signal catalog across:
   - service health and availability;
   - latency and throughput;
   - model, tool, connector, and knowledge dependency health;
   - quality and safety;
   - user outcomes, adoption, and feedback;
   - consumption and cost;
   - release and version identity.
3. Classify each signal as symptom, cause, diagnostic context, or business
   outcome.
4. Define a target, warning level, critical condition, owner, review cadence, and
   response for each actionable signal.
5. Identify blind spots and unsupported expectations before implementation.

### Expected outputs and evidence

- Operational charter and critical journey map
- Service objectives and error-budget principles where applicable
- Signal and dependency catalog
- Quality and safety monitoring requirements
- Data classification, access, retention, and redaction requirements
- Support and escalation model

## Phase 2 - Select observability and operations tooling

### Objective

Select the minimum set of native and extended tools needed to answer operational
questions and support incident response.

### Cross-platform selection criteria

- Native platform visibility and supportability
- Required trace, session, transcript, dependency, and business context
- Telemetry latency and retention
- Query, dashboard, alert, and export needs
- Identity, role, and transcript access controls
- Data residency, privacy, and sensitive-content handling
- Cost, sampling, and ingestion limits
- Integration with incident, on-call, work-item, and release systems

### Microsoft Foundry implementation path

1. Use Foundry tracing to understand agent, model, and tool execution.
2. Connect the Foundry project to Application Insights for the Agent Monitoring
   Dashboard and Azure Monitor analysis.
3. Use OpenTelemetry instrumentation for custom application logic not captured
   by platform-side tracing.
4. Use scheduled or continuous evaluation where supported to add sampled quality
   and safety signals to production monitoring.
5. Use Azure Monitor alerts and customer-standard dashboards for actionable
   operational signals.
6. Treat the [AgentOps Accelerator](https://aka.ms/agentops-accelerator) as an
   optional **Foundry-specific** reference for reading Foundry/Application
   Insights evidence and producing readiness findings. It is not a Copilot
   Studio implementation path and does not replace Azure Monitor or Foundry.

### Microsoft Copilot Studio implementation path

1. Use Copilot Studio Analytics for performance, outcomes, themes, adoption,
   satisfaction, and component usage appropriate to the agent experience.
2. Use the Monitor experience for recent activity, sessions or runs, reactions,
   response quality, tool use, and failures where available.
3. Use transcripts and session detail only with approved roles and data handling.
   Note the documented differences between analytics retention and transcript
   availability.
4. Configure agent-level Application Insights telemetry only when native
   analytics is insufficient and the additional data is approved.
5. Use Dataverse or approved reporting patterns for longer-term or custom
   analytics when required.
6. Use recurring Copilot Studio evaluations to validate changes; do not treat
   analytics alone as a release-quality test.

### Expected outputs and evidence

- Tooling decision record and platform boundary
- Telemetry and analytics data-flow diagram
- Workspace, project, environment, and resource inventory
- Access and role model
- Sampling, retention, and cost decision
- Integration points with incident and release management

## Phase 3 - Prepare telemetry, alerts, and runbooks

### Objective

Make the agent diagnosable and prepare responders before production traffic
arrives.

### Telemetry preparation

1. Define stable service, agent, version, environment, conversation/session, and
   release identifiers.
2. Instrument the critical path across agent invocation, model calls, tool/action
   use, retrieval, connectors, and downstream dependencies where supported.
3. Capture status, duration, dependency outcome, usage, and safe business context.
4. Avoid placing secrets, access tokens, unnecessary prompts/responses, personal
   data, or sensitive tool payloads in telemetry.
5. Configure redaction, sampling, retention, access, and export controls.
6. Generate controlled traffic and verify end-to-end correlation before release.

### Dashboard preparation

Build role-oriented views rather than one universal dashboard:

- **Service owner:** availability, success, latency, volume, cost, and releases.
- **Agent engineer or maker:** failed sessions/runs, model and tool behavior,
  knowledge/retrieval issues, and version comparison.
- **Quality and Responsible AI:** evaluation trends, critical-scenario failures,
  safety signals, feedback, and escalation.
- **Support:** user-visible symptom, session/trace lookup, recent changes,
  dependency status, and escalation path.
- **Business owner:** adoption, completion, resolution, escalation, satisfaction,
  and value indicators.

### Alert preparation

1. Alert only on conditions that require action.
2. Combine symptom and diagnostic context where possible.
3. Define severity, threshold, evaluation window, suppression, owner, and
   escalation.
4. Include links to the relevant dashboard, query, session/trace search, recent
   release, and runbook.
5. Distinguish no-traffic/no-data from healthy behavior.
6. Test access from the on-call identity, not only the implementer's account.

### Runbook outline preparation

Prepare concise decision guidance for:

- agent unavailable or elevated failure rate;
- latency or timeout increase;
- model, quota, or capacity issue;
- tool, connector, authentication, or permission failure;
- knowledge freshness, retrieval, or grounding regression;
- quality or safety signal degradation;
- unexpected cost or usage increase;
- release regression;
- telemetry silence or analytics delay;
- privacy, security, or harmful-output escalation.

Each outline should identify detection evidence, first checks, containment,
escalation, rollback or disablement options, communications, and the evidence to
preserve. Link to product runbooks rather than duplicating every product step in
this field guide.

### Platform-specific preparation

| Microsoft Foundry | Microsoft Copilot Studio |
| --- | --- |
| Connect Application Insights; verify traces and dashboard data; confirm Log Analytics access; instrument custom logic; define continuous/scheduled evaluation where appropriate | Publish to the intended nonproduction environment; verify Analytics and Monitor evidence; assign Analytics Viewer and transcript roles deliberately; configure optional Application Insights; document analytics and transcript availability |

### Expected outputs and evidence

- Instrumentation and correlation specification
- Verified telemetry sample
- Role-oriented dashboards
- Actionable alert catalog
- Runbook outlines and escalation matrix
- Privacy, access, sampling, and retention configuration record

## Phase 4 - Execute observability and operational readiness

### Objective

Verify that evidence is complete, alerts are actionable, and responders can
diagnose realistic failures.

### Execution activities

1. Generate representative traffic for critical journeys, failures, refusals,
   tool use, and dependency degradation.
2. Verify that every critical journey can be located by agent, version,
   environment, and session or trace identity.
3. Confirm dashboards distinguish success, failure, no-data, and delayed-data
   states.
4. Trigger alerts in a controlled environment and confirm routing, deduplication,
   acknowledgement, and context.
5. Run operational game days covering at least:
   - a release regression;
   - a dependency or permission failure;
   - a quality or safety concern;
   - telemetry silence.
6. Measure detection, triage, containment, and recovery time.
7. Confirm that responders can access necessary evidence without overbroad
   permissions.
8. Record gaps and repeat the rehearsal after remediation.

### Microsoft Foundry evidence

- Foundry trace and agent version
- Application Insights operation/trace identity
- Agent Monitoring Dashboard and relevant Azure Monitor query
- Evaluation result or continuous-evaluation evidence when used
- Release identity and deployment timestamp

### Microsoft Copilot Studio evidence

- Power Platform environment and agent identity
- Copilot Studio session/run and publish identity
- Analytics or Monitor view and relevant transcript/activity evidence
- Tool/connector and channel context
- Test-set run or regression evidence when used
- Solution/release version and deployment timestamp

### Expected outputs and evidence

- End-to-end telemetry verification record
- Dashboard and query validation
- Alert delivery and actionability results
- Game-day timeline and findings
- Updated runbook outlines
- Operational readiness decision

## Phase 5 - Continuously improve after execution

### Objective

Use production evidence to improve the agent, evaluation coverage, release
controls, and operating practice.

### Activities

1. Establish daily, weekly, monthly, and release-based review cadences according
   to signal urgency.
2. Review trends by agent and release version, channel, user journey, language,
   tool, and dependency.
3. Sample and human-review quality or safety cases according to approved privacy
   rules.
4. Promote reviewed incidents, failed sessions, themes, reactions, and edge
   cases into evaluation datasets or Copilot Studio test sets.
5. Link improvements to the originating evidence and verify them with the same
   regression case.
6. Tune alerts when they are noisy, late, unactionable, or blind to meaningful
   failures.
7. Review telemetry cost, sampling, retention, and access.
8. Review platform changes, preview status, deprecations, model changes,
   connector changes, and policy updates.
9. Conduct periodic service reviews across product, engineering, operations,
   quality, safety, and business stakeholders.

### Platform-specific improvement loop

| Microsoft Foundry | Microsoft Copilot Studio |
| --- | --- |
| Review traces and monitoring, convert approved production evidence into evaluation coverage, rerun Foundry evaluations, and feed results into release gates | Review Analytics, Monitor, sessions/transcripts, themes and feedback, add approved cases to test sets, rerun evaluations, and promote changes through Power Platform ALM |

### Expected outputs and evidence

- Continuous improvement backlog with evidence links
- Production-derived regression cases
- Trend and service review record
- Alert and dashboard tuning history
- Updated quality, safety, and operational thresholds
- Retired or remediated blind spots

## Phase 6 - Project ending and knowledge transfer

### Objective

Ensure customer teams can monitor, diagnose, respond, and improve independently.

### Knowledge transfer activities

1. Walk through the operational charter, signal catalog, data flow, and platform
   boundaries.
2. Demonstrate trace/session lookup from an alert through likely root cause and
   release identity.
3. Have customer operators run a game-day scenario using customer-managed
   access.
4. Review privacy, transcript, trace, and sensitive-data handling.
5. Review recurring service, quality, safety, cost, and access reviews.
6. Transfer dashboards, queries, alerts, runbook outlines, and evaluation links.
7. Record ownership, support paths, escalation contacts, and next review dates.
